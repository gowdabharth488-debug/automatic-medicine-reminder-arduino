## Project report
Automatic Medicine Reminder Using Arduino with GSM SMS Alert

## Abstract: 
In today’s fast-paced world, managing daily medication schedules has become a critical concern, particularly for elderly patients and people with chronic illnesses. Missing or delaying medication can lead to serious health complications. The Automatic Medicine Reminder project provides a reliable solution by integrating microcontroller-based automation, real-time clock monitoring, and GSM communication. This system ensures timely alerts for medicine intake through visual, audio, and SMS notifications. Additionally, it can detect whether the medicine has been taken using infrared (IR) sensors and maintains a log in EEPROM for future reference. The project utilizes an Arduino Mega microcontroller along with RTC DS3231, IR sensors, LEDs, a 16x2 LCD, buzzer, and a Quectel EC200U GSM module, providing an intelligent, real-time, and connected solution for medicine management.

## Introduction:
Managing multiple medicines on a fixed schedule can be challenging, especially for senior citizens or patients with chronic diseases. Traditional methods, such as alarms or manual reminders, are prone to human error and often unreliable. The Automatic Medicine Reminder project introduces an automated solution using modern electronics and IoT-based alerting. The system is designed to remind patients at precise intervals, detect the removal of medicine from its storage, and alert caregivers or family members via SMS if a dose is missed. It leverages the Arduino Mega microcontroller for its multiple I/O pins, the DS3231 RTC module for precise real-time monitoring, and the GSM module for remote communication. Infrared sensors ensure that the medicine has been physically taken, while LEDs, a buzzer, and the LCD provide immediate feedback, making the device user-friendly and reliable.

## Circuit Description: 
The core of the system is the Arduino Mega 2560, which acts as the central controller by monitoring the RTC, IR sensors, and push buttons, while controlling LEDs, the buzzer, and the LCD. The RTC DS3231 module provides accurate timekeeping, allowing alerts to be triggered at scheduled medicine times. Four IR emitter and receiver pairs are positioned in medicine slots to detect whether medicine has been removed. Four indicator LEDs show which medicine slot is due, and a 16x2 LCD displays the current time, slot status, and alerts. The buzzer produces audio notifications, while push buttons with internal pull-up resistors allow manual acknowledgment, reset, or navigation. The Quectel EC200U GSM module handles SMS and call alerts to up to two numbers, and EEPROM stores logs of taken or missed medicines to preserve data even during power outages. Connections include IR sensors with current-limiting resistors and voltage dividers, LEDs connected via 220Ω resistors to Arduino pins D6–D9, the LCD connected through standard RS, EN, and D4–D7 pins, and the GSM module connected to Arduino serial pins TX1 and RX1 with voltage-level matching. The system is powered by a lithium-ion battery setup with step-down regulation to provide stable 5V and 3.3V outputs.

## Working Principle:
The system continuously monitors time using the RTC, with pre-set medicine schedules stored in the Arduino memory. When a scheduled medicine time arrives, the corresponding LED lights up, the buzzer sounds, and the LCD displays the alert. The IR sensors check if the medicine has been removed. If the medicine is taken, the event is logged in EEPROM, and the alert is turned off. If the medicine is not taken, the GSM module sends SMS and call notifications to the designated numbers. Push buttons allow the user to manually acknowledge or reset alerts, and the system continuously returns to monitoring mode, waiting for the next scheduled time. This combination of automation, sensing, and communication ensures accurate and reliable medication reminders.

## Applications: 
The project is particularly useful for elderly patients or individuals with chronic conditions who require timely medication reminders. Hospitals and nursing homes can use this system for automated patient monitoring, and home care systems benefit from its remote alert capabilities via GSM. More broadly, this technology can be applied to general automation and IoT-based healthcare devices, providing an intelligent solution to medication management challenges.

## Conclusion: 
The Automatic Medicine Reminder project effectively demonstrates how hardware and software integration can solve real-world healthcare problems. By combining Arduino Mega, RTC, IR sensors, GSM communication, LEDs, and buzzers, the system reliably alerts users about scheduled medicine intake and notifies caregivers if doses are missed. Future improvements could include mobile app integration, internet-based notifications, and support for additional medicine slots. Overall, this project serves as a practical demonstration of how embedded systems, electronics, and IoT technologies can improve healthcare and ensure timely medication management.
